This repo is for my solutions of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
annual event. As a very narcissic person I share them for the whole world to
see how shitty my coding skills are. (For people who would not get it,
this is sarcasm).

Some code might include bits I got here and there on the internet. If the
authors recognize a pattern they used and would like to be credited, tell me,
I often try to comment my sources so I'll be glad if I effectively stole it
from you and forgot to mention.

I still try to make my own solutions and that is part of the game, so if
you are struggling, please, only look at solutions after you alredy tried
solving the puzzle for some time. You will learn nothing reading other
people solutions if you don't think about it yourself first.

If you have any remark or advice to share, do not hesitate to reach me.

Obviously inputs are the one associated with MY account. So use yours.
